# TONKAIN-TRAINING
Training to become a firmware developer
In this training, I will start by revising the basics of C as though I knew nothing in it.
I have a strict plan to follow and a mentor to discuss with in any case I am stuck.
After the basics, I will see how to use C for microcontrollers and many others.

All that is needed and adviced is GRIT, RESILIENCE, RESPECT and FOCUS.

Well, let's march FIRE!!!!
